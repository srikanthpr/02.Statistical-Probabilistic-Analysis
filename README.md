# 02.Statistical & Probabilistic Analysis of Store Sales, University Survey, & Manufacturing data

The project involved drawing inferences from 3 case studies, namely - Wholesale Customer Data (Store Sales), University Survey Data & Manufacturing Shingles Data. The concepts of various measures of Descriptive Statistics, Probability and Probability Distributions and various measures of Estimation & Hypothesis Testing are used to analyse these case studies.

## Skills and Tools:
-Descriptive Statistics
-Probability & Probability Distributions
-Estimation
-Hypothesis Testing

## Case-1 : Wholesale Customer Analysis:
A wholesale distributor operating in different regions of Portugal has information on annual spending of several items in their stores across different regions and channels. The data (Wholesale Customer.csv) consists of 440 large retailersâ€™ annual spending on 6 different varieties of products in 3 different regions (Lisbon, Oporto, Other) and across different sales channel (Hotel, Retail).
The following Distributor and Product variables to study:

|Type    | Data-type | Variables |
|:---    | :-------- | :-------- | 
|Region  | Nominal   | Lisbon    |
|        |           | Oporto    |
|        |           | Other     |
|Channel | Nominal   | Hotel     |
|        |           | Retail    |
|Products| Continuous| Fresh Products |
|        |           | Milk Products|
|        |           | Grocery Products|
|        |           | Frozen Products|
|        |           | Detergent Products|
|        |           | Delicatessen Products|

# 1.1	Use methods of descriptive statistics to summarize data:
           -Which Region and which Channel seems to spend more? AND
           -Which Region and which Channel seems to spend less?
# 1.2	There are 6 different varieties of items are considered:
           -Do all varieties show similar behaviour across Region and Channel?

# 1.3	 On the basis of the descriptive measure of variability:
            Which item shows the most inconsistent behaviour?
            Which item shows the Least inconsistent behaviour?
            
# 1.4	 Are there any outliers in the data?

# 1.5 On the basis of this report, what are the recommendations?

## Case-2 : University Survey:
