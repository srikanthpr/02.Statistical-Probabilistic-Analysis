# 02.Statistical & Probabilistic Analysis of Store Sales, University Survey, & Manufacturing data

The project involved drawing inferences from 3 case studies, namely - Wholesale Customer Data (Store Sales), University Survey Data & Manufacturing Shingles Data. The concepts of various measures of Descriptive Statistics, Probability and Probability Distributions and various measures of Estimation & Hypothesis Testing are used to analyse these case studies.

## Skills and Tools:
-Descriptive Statistics
-Probability & Probability Distributions
-Estimation
-Hypothesis Testing

### Case-1 : Wholesale Customer Analysis:
A wholesale distributor operating in different regions of Portugal has information on annual spending of several items in their stores across different regions and channels. The data (Wholesale Customer.csv) consists of 440 large retailersâ€™ annual spending on 6 different varieties of products in 3 different regions (Lisbon, Oporto, Other) and across different sales channel (Hotel, Retail).
The following Distributor and Product variables to study:

|Type    | Data-type | Variables |
|:---    | :-------- | :-------- | 
|Region  | Nominal   | Lisbon    |
|        |           | Oporto    |
|        |           | Other     |
|Channel | Nominal   | Hotel     |
|        |           | Retail    |
|Products| Continuous| Fresh Products |
|        |           | Milk Products|
|        |           | Grocery Products|
|        |           | Frozen Products|
|        |           | Detergent Products|
|        |           | Delicatessen Products|

#### 1.1	Use methods of descriptive statistics to summarize data:
           -Which Region and which Channel seems to spend more? AND
           -Which Region and which Channel seems to spend less?
#### 1.2	There are 6 different varieties of items are considered:
           -Do all varieties show similar behaviour across Region and Channel?

#### 1.3	 On the basis of the descriptive measure of variability:
            Which item shows the most inconsistent behaviour?
            Which item shows the Least inconsistent behaviour?
            
#### 1.4	 Are there any outliers in the data?

#### 1.5 On the basis of this report, what are the observations and recommendations?

### Case-2 : University Student Survey:

The Student News Service at Clear Mountain State University (CMSU) has decided to gather data about the undergraduate students that attend CMSU. CMSU creates and distributes a survey of 14 questions and receives responses from 62 undergraduates (stored in the Survey.csv file).

#### Part I

#### 2.1. For this data, construct the following contingency tables (Keep Gender as row variable)

           2.1.1. Gender and Major
           2.1.2. Gender and Grad Intention
           2.1.3. Gender and Employment
           2.1.4. Gender and Computer
 
#### 2.2. Assume that the sample is a representative of the population of CMSU. Based on the data, answer the following questions:

           2.2.1. What is the probability that a randomly selected CMSU student will be male?
                  What is the probability that a randomly selected CMSU student will be female?

           2.2.2. Find the conditional probability of different majors among the male students in CMSU.
                  Find the conditional probability of different majors among the female students of CMSU.

           2.2.3. Find the conditional probability of intent to graduate, given that the student is a male.
                  Find the conditional probability of intent to graduate, given that the student is a female.

           2.2.4. Find the conditional probability of employment status for the male students as well as for the female students.

           2.2.5. Find the conditional probability of laptop preference among the male students as well as among the female students.
 

#### 2.3. Based on the above probabilities, do you think that the column variable in each case is independent of Gender? Justify your comment in each case.

#### Part II

#### 2.4. Note that there are three numerical (continuous) variables in the data set, Salary, Spending and Text Messages. For each of them comment whether they follow a normal distribution. Write a note summarizing your conclusions.
[Recall that symmetric histogram does not necessarily mean that the underlying distribution is symmetric]
